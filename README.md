# Music Mayhem 🎧

Welcome to the Music Mayhem, a sleek and intuitive application designed to enhance your music listening experience on both Android and iOS platforms.

# Features 🔥

💁‍♂️ Play, Pause, and Navigate: Effortlessly control your music playback with the touch of a button. Play your favorite tracks, pause to savor the moment, and easily navigate through other musics.

💁‍♂️ Next and Previous Track: Seamlessly move between tracks with the next and previous buttons. Whether you're in the mood for the next hit or want to revisit a favorite, the app has you covered.

## Getting Started 🚀

First, you will need to install **Node Modules**, which contains the dependencies (libraries) that your project relies on.

To Install **Node Modules**, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn install
```

Following the successful installation of **Node Modules**, the next step involves installing **pods** for iOS.

```bash
cd ios && pod install
```

## Start your Application ⚡

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### Running the Android app 🤖

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### Running the iOS app 📱

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Congratulations! 🎉

You've successfully run your **Music Mayhem** App. 🥳

### Let's See Preview 🙈
